# Supervised Learning

####  Decision Trees

- **Advantages**
  1. Simple to understand and to interpret, trees can be visualized.
  2. Don't need much data preparation. Other algorithms often require data to be normalized, dummy variables to be created.
  3. Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
  4. Able to handle multi-output problems.
  5. Use a white box model (can be easily explained use boolean logic).
  6. Possible to validate a model using statistical tests.
  7. Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.
